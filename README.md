# TGCodes-Netflix-landing-page-clone
I have built a Netflix landing page clone with HTML and CSS. It closely resembles the original Netflix design and layout, featuring a responsive header, sections showcasing key features, FAQs, and a footer. The clone is built using modern web development techniques and can serve as a starting point for building similar websites.
